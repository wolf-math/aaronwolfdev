Hey everyone! It’s been a while since I’ve updated my website!  

When I first built it, I designed it so that all content updates would happen automatically via API calls. That was over 3 years ago. Over time, though, I realized that approach wasn’t the best fit for what I wanted, So I decided to rebuild it from the ground up. 

The original version was made with the now deprecated **Create React App**, but this new site is powered by **Docusaurus**, another React framework from Meta designed for building blogs and documentation.

The overall look is mostly the same, with a few small tweaks, but the biggest change is the addition of the **Blog** and **Docs** sections.

Things are a work in progress right now. I'm currently working on writing the docs for the [Python language reference](../docs/Coding/Python%20Docs/Language%20reference)

I hope you enjoy exploring the new site and check back often for updates!
